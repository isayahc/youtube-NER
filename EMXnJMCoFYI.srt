1
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,310
In September of 2022, a video
began circulating online

2
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,480
of a man named Yevgeny
Prigozhin at a prison in Russia

3
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,360
speaking to inmates and offering them

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,943
the chance to fight in Ukraine.

5
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,100
Yevgeny Prigozhin was an acquaintance

6
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,313
of Vladimir Putin's from
St. Petersburg in the 1990s.

7
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,220
He's close to Vladimir Putin.

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,930
He actually got his start

9
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,260
focusing more on catering
businesses and restaurants,

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,690
earning himself the nickname Putin's chef.

11
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,150
In the beginning, he
stayed in the shadows.

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,070
He rarely appeared.

13
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,960
He was named by some Western officials

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,910
as being in charge of Wagner Group,

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,980
but the Kremlin kept it very hush hush.

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,900
They didn't want it to be known

17
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,220
that this group really existed,

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,680
they denied knowing anything about it.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,820
Wagner is nothing like what
Americans might understand.

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,830
It's a private military company.

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,370
Wagner are mercenaries for hire.

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,160
They massacre and rape civilians,

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,720
they exploit, loot natural
resources, and they carry it off,

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,613
much of this back to the Kremlin.

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,760
The significance of this video

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,000
is it immediately ties
Prigozhin to the Wagner Group.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,070
He'd always denied any involvement

28
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,960
but here you have him on camera

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,060
describing Wagner as his group

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,220
and describing what they're doing.

31
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,937
It was a way of planting
the flag and saying,

32
00:01:45,937 --> 00:01:47,190
"I'm in charge here.

33
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,940
I've got permission to
do whatever I'd like."

34
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:02,370
That is in fact the function

35
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:04,020
of the coming out story,

36
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,270
to convince us that that is the only story

37
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,124
that there is to know.

38
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:10,170
This is a business story
at the end of the day.

39
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,660
This is a story about the exchange

40
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,078
of billions and billions of dollars

41
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:17,820
for large scale weapon platforms,

42
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:21,693
for train and equip missions,
for oil and gas exploitation.

43
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,240
What we're really seeing here

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,680
is a very strange organization
that doesn't look at all

45
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,140
like your classic
private military company.

46
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,330
In fact, it's probably better to call it

47
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,247
a state-backed paramilitary cartel.

48
00:02:46,089 --> 00:02:50,010
Are you a Russian soldier?

49
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,530
The shadowy pro-Russian forces here

50
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,903
violently took over government facilities.

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,035
The Russian mercenaries were from the-

52
00:02:58,035 --> 00:02:58,973
Wagner Group.

53
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:01,470
The Wagner Group.
The Wagner Group,

54
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,157
a shadowy security firm
linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin.

55
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,080
The tentacles of Wagner
spread across Africa,

56
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,763
Syria, and Ukraine.

57
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,990
They relish in their brutality.

58
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,220
Nothing could be more appropriate

59
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,343
than designating it as a
foreign terrorist organization.

60
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,620
Could someone like Prigozhin

61
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,980
ever actually threaten
Vladimir Putin's hold on power?

62
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,480
It's absolutely unclear how this will end.

63
00:04:03,571 --> 00:04:05,940
In the 10 years since its founding,

64
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,230
the Wagner Group has evolved

65
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,230
from a small guns for higher operation

66
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:12,270
into a sprawling network of businesses

67
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,850
that has been active on four continents.

68
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,940
This is setting up a broader
network of infrastructure

69
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,030
where Wagner could
potentially surge presence

70
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,390
in response to a given
opportunity or threat

71
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:27,330
and also it creates the opportunity

72
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,210
to sort of lily pad their influence

73
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,130
from one country to another.

74
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,960
Wagner currently has approximately

75
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,450
50,000 personnel deployed to Ukraine,

76
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:40,443
including 10,000 contractors
and 40,000 convicts.

77
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,520
President Putin wants Russia
to be a great power again.

78
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,460
He wants it to have
control throughout not only

79
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,100
Europe and Asia, but also in Africa

80
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,930
and other parts of the world.

81
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,110
He's been able to send in his
mercenaries through Wagner

82
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,577
to do the dirty work.

83
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:01,740
The Wall Street Journal

84
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,580
examined shipping records,
government databases,

85
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,550
sanctions documents and corporate records

86
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,210
to identify 64 companies
linked to Wagner's founder,

87
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,383
Yevgeny Prigozhin.

88
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,850
We found more than half of
those are being used by Wagner

89
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,280
as a complex network of front companies

90
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,500
to hide the flow of money and materials

91
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,483
that ultimately connect to the Kremlin.

92
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,180
Neither the Kremlin nor Prigozhin

93
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,510
responded to requests for
comment about our findings.

94
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,310
The monies would flow

95
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,680
back through the corporate form

96
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,560
and they could be used to pay salaries,

97
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,230
they could be used to pay weaponry,

98
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,140
they could be used to pay for everything

99
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,060
that a military needs,

100
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,210
but not coming through the Russian state.

101
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,650
It's always gonna be a game

102
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,560
of whack-a-mole for the
US and other governments

103
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,170
because the more companies
that are sanctioned,

104
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,670
the more companies will be
created to evade sanctions.

105
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,940
Every part of what the Wagner Group does

106
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,820
is directed by the state for the state

107
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,170
to the profit of the state.

108
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,750
But from the beginning,

109
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,730
the Wagner Group was carefully engineered

110
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:23,580
to hide its connection to the Kremlin.

111
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,080
Ukrainian and Western officials

112
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,690
say that the way it was
done was Yevgeny Prigozhin

113
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,600
through his catering company, Concord,

114
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,540
was making money from
defense industry contracts

115
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,790
so he was getting
contracts to provide food

116
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,790
and other services for the Russian army,

117
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,660
which he was then able to
reinvest into the Wagner Group.

118
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,660
It is a classic money
laundering technique.

119
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,880
Concord Catering was what it sounds like.

120
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,550
It was set up as a catering company

121
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,160
that had sweetheart
deals with the Kremlin.

122
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,660
So the Kremlin would pay it

123
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,090
and it was the catering company.

124
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,410
And then as part of that,

125
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,920
there are ways to skim
that money off the top

126
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,790
and ensure that the money
goes to the appropriate folks

127
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,220
that Prigozhin wants to pay.

128
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,620
It was through parts of that money flow

129
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,353
that it's expected that
Wagner got its start.

130
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,110
The origin story of the Wagner Group

131
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,913
is basically a battlefield rumor.

132
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,547
At the beginning of the war in Donbas

133
00:07:26,547 --> 00:07:29,490
and the annexation of Crimea in 2014,

134
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,237
we saw a lot of guys without insignia,

135
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:33,990
you know, the little
green men running around

136
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,593
and they were often talked
about as not being there.

137
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,720
The Kremlin always believed

138
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,670
that Ukraine should be part of Russia

139
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,030
and that naturally the
Ukrainians should support Russia

140
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,080
so it tried to foment a
revolution, some kind of uprising

141
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,790
in Eastern Ukraine.

142
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,830
Russia used small mercenary groups

143
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,140
to support pro-Russian separatists

144
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,720
in their fight against Ukrainian forces.

145
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,210
Now one of these groups was Wagner.

146
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,321
Because they offered plausible deniability

147
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:06,510
for the Russians, they could
say that these were locals

148
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,820
that had simply decided to rise up

149
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,460
against the rulers in Kyiv.

150
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,870
There are no Russian units

151
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,470
in the east of Ukraine, no
special services, no instructors.

152
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,623
Those are all local residents.

153
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,150
Dmitry Utkin was one of
the original commanders

154
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,150
in Wagner and in fact,
his call sign was Wagner

155
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,860
and that's what gave the unit its name.

156
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,060
Now he was known as Wagner

157
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,833
because of his neo-Nazi sympathies.

158
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,620
Russia's attempt to foment an uprising

159
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,560
in Donbas ultimately
faced stiff resistance

160
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,540
from the Ukrainian army.

161
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,300
And according to the Ukrainian
intelligence service,

162
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,940
the Kremlin used Utkin and his Wagner unit

163
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,220
to target pro-Russian separatists

164
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,303
who opposed negotiating
a ceasefire with Ukraine.

165
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,380
Essentially, they were a
death squad that was sent out

166
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,960
to clean up any of the political problems

167
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,340
that the Kremlin was dealing with

168
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,990
during this negotiation process.

169
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,990
The might of Wagner Group
rose from year to year

170
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,480
because they appear to be very effective

171
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,300
for this Russian authoritarian regime.

172
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,150
For Putin himself, he could hide

173
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,250
any kind of his criminal activities

174
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,756
using these kind of troops.

175
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:08,940
In 2015, Russia intervened

176
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,670
in the Syrian Civil
War and Wagner was used

177
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,090
to protect energy resources
for the Assad regime.

178
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,450
It was the beginning of a new
business model for the group.

179
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,450
And in return, they get a
share of the natural resources,

180
00:11:24,012 --> 00:11:26,790
the looting of the country.

181
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,740
It was a pivotal role in a conflict

182
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,323
that put one of Russia's most
important allies at risk.

183
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:50,700
That meant Wagner and the Russian military

184
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,940
fought against any combination
of US-backed rebels,

185
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,343
Kurdish forces, and ISIS.

186
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,870
Wagner employed its fighters in Syria

187
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,870
through a company called Evro Polis.

188
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,080
Evro Polis was also the company
the Syrian government hired

189
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,372
to protect its oil fields.

190
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,390
Ultimately these shell companies

191
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,090
that are paying the salaries
of Wagner Group fighters,

192
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,440
they're nothing more than that.

193
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,040
They're just paper pass
throughs that allow Russia

194
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,800
to manage money and men

195
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,760
and make sure that there are
no prying eyes in the deals.

196
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,440
Oil was particularly lucrative

197
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,590
for Wagner in Syria.

198
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,090
Evro Polis's contract
with the Syrian government

199
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,970
shows that for every
oil field it captured,

200
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,343
it got 25% of production.

201
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,590
25% of the natural resources,
the energy resources

202
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,660
that were able to be exploited.

203
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:14,660
An incredible amount for a
company far afield in Russia.

204
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,000
By 2017, Wagner captured at least four

205
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,460
of the country's largest
oil and gas fields,

206
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,040
which earned the group
tens of millions of dollars

207
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,140
per year from each field.

208
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,420
Make sure that you secure the oil and gas,

209
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,010
get it before the Americans get it

210
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,440
or get it before the Kurds
get it, but get there.

211
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,613
That was the objective.

212
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,330
Al-Shaer gas field in Homs

213
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,970
is one of the largest in Syria.

214
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,270
In 2017, Wagner worked
with the Syrian military

215
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,430
to defend it from ISIS.

216
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,690
Many of the Syrian troops

217
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:48,543
had been forced into
service by the Assad regime.

218
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,210
During a Battle with ISIS,

219
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,523
some of those Syrian
fighters tried to escape.

220
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,920
Wagner found one of them

221
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,903
and decided to make an example of him.

222
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,443
His name was Muhammad Ismail.

223
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,580
Wagner fighters filmed themselves

224
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,840
as they tortured, killed, and
mutilated Muhammad Ismail.

225
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,070
We see kind of this impulse
toward memorializing

226
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,900
terrorizing incidents.

227
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,940
This helps with the kind
of psychological effects.

228
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,110
Don't mess with us.

229
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,714
We're coming and when
we come, be prepared.

230
00:14:51,536 --> 00:14:54,930
In 2018, Wagner forces
attempted to capture

231
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,847
the Conoco gas plant in Kasham
from US-backed rebel forces.

232
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,120
There was already kind of a lot of tension

233
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,010
leading up to the Battle of Kasham,

234
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,920
and then when the Russian regular forces

235
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,600
couldn't give the Americans an answer,

236
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,090
a satisfactory answer
as to who was down there

237
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,450
doing that fighting creeping
toward the Conoco gas plant,

238
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,970
well, it was kind of all bets off.

239
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,640
The US military sent up a
whole bunch of air cover

240
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,557
and it was an absolute bombardment.

241
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,440
Even though Wagner lost the fight

242
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,210
for the Conoco gas plant,

243
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:00,047
they still served a
very important purpose,

244
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:03,390
taking heavy losses that the
Russian military couldn't.

245
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,070
You can't count what you can't see

246
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,070
and you can't count what you don't know.

247
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,780
One of my duties was to
actually fly on board

248
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,670
of transport aircrafts.

249
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,640
Russian military aircrafts
were filled with bodies

250
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,150
killed in action operators
from Wagner Group.

251
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,720
What I witnessed being at mission at Syria

252
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,290
as an Air Force officer
was this Wagner Group

253
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,773
used all the resources of
Russian official military.

254
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,860
They used their military aviation,

255
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,320
they used their logistic capabilities,

256
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,080
they used their military bases.

257
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,540
By 2019, the Syrian government

258
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,720
awarded several Wagner companies
oil and gas drilling rights

259
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,280
to about 10,000 square miles
of land across the country.

260
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,370
As recently as 2021, a Wagner company

261
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,590
was awarded oil and gas drilling rights

262
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:59,644
for 2000 square miles
of offshore territory.

263
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,620
Some would point to Syria

264
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,340
as a pretty successful model
of how business could be done.

265
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,167
They went in surreptitiously,

266
00:17:07,167 --> 00:17:10,920
they managed to grab back a
lot of the important oil, gas,

267
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,820
and mineral resources for the
Syrian state and for Russia,

268
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,033
and they did that at minimal cost.

269
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,230
Russia's found itself
a very successful model

270
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,730
and it wanted to replicate it.

271
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,720
And the group did just that

272
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,433
as it expanded to Africa.

273
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,020
I'd say the biggest success
for the Wagner Group

274
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,603
that we know of now is in
the Central African Republic.

275
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,290
In Africa, Wagner set up

276
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,980
even more shell companies
to mine natural resources

277
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,530
and sell them around the world.

278
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,720
Wagner was able to do that

279
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,190
through offering security services.

280
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,540
Wagner targets countries

281
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,970
with ongoing security issues.

282
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,640
Some are former French colonies
with governments weakened

283
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,043
in the wake of reduced
French military presence.

284
00:18:20,547 --> 00:18:22,860
In the Central African Republic,

285
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,160
Wagner uses a company called
Sewa Security Services

286
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,930
to provide security to the president

287
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,673
and other high level officials.

288
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:34,140
Sewa is a subsidiary of Lobaye Invest,

289
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,807
which has at least three
mining licenses in the country.

290
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:04,080
The first Wagner troops arrived

291
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,740
in the Central African
Republic in January of 2018

292
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,520
where they quickly got to work
carrying out training tasks

293
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,640
and setting up bases where
they could help to instruct

294
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,056
local armed forces.

295
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,230
Wagner quickly got to
work taking over mines.

296
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,440
One of the largest is a
roughly 138 square mile

297
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,563
swath of land known as the Ndassima mine.

298
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,763
It was a small scale mine where
everything was done by hand.

299
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,710
Wagner developed it

300
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,893
into the only industrialized
gold mine in the country.

301
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,830
I'm a lawyer for Axmin,

302
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,050
a company based in
Central African Republic.

303
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,360
We've been listed in Toronto Exchange.

304
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Axmin was granted the Ndassima
mining license back in 2010.

305
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,530
Unfortunately, in 2013,
a civil war broke out

306
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,270
so obviously as a company,

307
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,243
we weren't able to go into exploration.

308
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,360
Rebel groups like the Union for Peace,

309
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,630
known as UPC, took control
of the Ndassima mine

310
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,340
for the next several years,

311
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,840
until Wagner forces took over around 2017.

312
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:12,420
In 2019, we received a
document from the government

313
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,210
saying that our permit was canceled.

314
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,413
Two months later, we received
information that in fact,

315
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:24,210
Midas, which in fact was run by Wagner,

316
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,763
it was awarded our license in Ndassima.

317
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,300
Midas Resources is a Wagner company

318
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,063
created for mining in the
Central African Republic.

319
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,970
The Journal was unable to find

320
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,313
any prior mining history for Midas.

321
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,070
In a 2011 report, Axmin projected Ndassima

322
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,670
could produce more than
1.4 million ounces of gold

323
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,293
over about eight years.

324
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,330
That's nearly $3 billion
worth at today's prices.

325
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,420
Today, the government
has no way of knowing

326
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,040
what's going on in the field

327
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,160
because it has become off
limit for the government

328
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,040
since Wagner took over.

329
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,480
Satellite imagery analyzed

330
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,460
by The Wall Street
Journal further confirms

331
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,203
Wagner's presence at the mine.

332
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:16,040
This December 2022 image shows
a Mi-8 or Mi-17 helicopter,

333
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,953
the same kind of choppers
Wagner uses elsewhere in Africa.

334
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,220
Here, a type of armored vehicle

335
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,980
military analysts call a Wagner wagon

336
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,280
is identifiable by its
roof mounted extra tire

337
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,380
and its pointed front end.

338
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,940
These customized combat trucks

339
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:36,333
were also used by Wagner
forces in Syria and Libya.

340
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,230
Satellite images show the expansion

341
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,363
and industrialization of the mine.

342
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,950
On the right, we can see heavy machinery.

343
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,440
We're able to actually see

344
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,620
some dump trucks and
diggers in the imagery

345
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,890
that have been expanding
these open pit mines.

346
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,110
On the left, we can see the expansion

347
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:01,053
of facilities and two processing lines.

348
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,530
Together, these developments
show the country's

349
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:09,530
first industrialized gold
mine built by Wagner.

350
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,480
We are not naive about the situation.

351
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,110
It's highly unlikely
that we will get it back.

352
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,520
As Wagner-linked companies

353
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,140
took control of mines,

354
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,573
its fighters killed anyone in their path.

355
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,310
One such incident occurred in
2021 in the village of Boyo,

356
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,893
about 100 miles south
of the Ndassima mine.

357
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,010
The Muslim community there was targeted

358
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,500
because Wagner forces and
their allies believed them

359
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,660
to be helping the UPC rebels,

360
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,577
who previously controlled the mine.

361
00:24:09,173 --> 00:24:11,130
The Boyo massacre was documented

362
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,210
in a 2022 report to the
UN Human Rights Council,

363
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,753
which detailed the brutal
assault on civilians there.

364
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,090
The Boyo Massacre is one small example

365
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,303
of atrocities Wagner has
committed across the continent.

366
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,990
At the same time, Wagner-backed companies

367
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,420
continue to spring up across Africa

368
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,880
in different sectors of the economy,

369
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,630
particularly in the
Central African Republic.

370
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,706
An overall playbook is step one,

371
00:24:55,706 --> 00:24:59,070
enter into a military technical
agreement with Country X,

372
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:01,320
Central African Republic, Mali.

373
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,550
You get the helicopters,

374
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,290
you get the guys who fly the helicopters.

375
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,520
You get the jet fighters,

376
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,190
you get the guys who
fly those jet fighters.

377
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,810
You get the infantry fighting vehicles,

378
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,520
you get the guys who drive them.

379
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,190
That's the playbook, but
then there's a second layer.

380
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,140
We see this narrative

381
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,530
of Russia coming in as
a friend and a helper

382
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,880
repeated in various types of
propaganda and disinformation,

383
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,600
ranging from Soviet art style billboards

384
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,150
in cities in the Central African Republic,

385
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:31,890
and even getting down to the level

386
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,557
of creating children's cartoons.

387
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,330
We will make sure that the story

388
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,860
that you're trying to
sell to your electorate

389
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,063
is the one that's sold on social media.

390
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,000
Officials, some people are just saddened

391
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,953
by what's happening in the country.

392
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,760
Things are getting worse and worse.

393
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,310
The country has become
a sort of rogue state

394
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:10,200
with the Wagner calling all the the shots

395
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,533
on behalf of the government.

396
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,330
U.S. and European security officials

397
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:45,330
told The Journal that Wagner
is also trying to expand

398
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,603
to Burkina Faso, Chad, and Ivory Coast.

399
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,673
Every weapon that goes
into Africa is money.

400
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,050
Every bit of gold that comes
out of Africa is money.

401
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,500
That money services a
lot of different needs.

402
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,680
It has been all along a
sanctions management strategy

403
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,630
insulating Russia from
what would inevitably come

404
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,273
if it ever crossed the line into Ukraine.

405
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:15,480
After backing Wagner

406
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,060
through its massive expansion in Africa,

407
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,350
Russia called the group back

408
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,690
for the urgent need of the state,

409
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,703
a full-scale war on Ukraine.

410
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,120
Wagner would soon outshine
the Russian military

411
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,980
on the battlefield.

412
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,720
It's expected that the money
that Wagner, Prigozhin,

413
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,720
and their front companies are
reaping throughout Africa,

414
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,810
hundreds of millions of dollars a year,

415
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:43,710
much of that is expected
to go back to Russia,

416
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,660
some into Prigozhin's pockets,

417
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:49,503
but much of it for the
war effort in Ukraine.

418
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,430
The initial invasion on February the 24th

419
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,940
was carried out by the Russian military.

420
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:59,670
They fired missiles,
they sent in war planes,

421
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:02,250
and then they sent in armored columns.

422
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,170
And they very much thought
that this was a war

423
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,753
that would last for a few days.

424
00:28:21,537 --> 00:28:23,700
We know that there was money flowing

425
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,240
outward from the Kremlin to
Prigozhin and his companies.

426
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,027
We know that some of that money
was funneled in to Wagner.

427
00:28:31,027 --> 00:28:33,270
The Wall Street Journal reviewed contracts

428
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:36,360
between the Russian
government and 25 companies

429
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,010
tied to Prigozhin, likely only
a small portion of the total.

430
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,877
Collectively, these
companies won more than

431
00:28:42,877 --> 00:28:47,590
$5 billion in contracts
between 2014 and 2023

432
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,220
with a notable spike in the amount

433
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,293
in the year after the war began.

434
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,690
So a significant amount of
money for guns, for tanks,

435
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,230
for other weaponry that can be used,

436
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,513
that all needs to be funded somehow.

437
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,560
As Moscow's plan to take Kyiv failed,

438
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,590
Russian troops and Wagner
fighters were stuck in towns

439
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,900
on the outskirts of the city.

440
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,120
One example that we have
of how the Wagner Group

441
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,060
was active around Kyiv was
from the village of Motyzhyn.

442
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,140
According to prosecutors

443
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,300
and according to the Ukrainian soldiers,

444
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,040
Wagner Group was brought in

445
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,123
as an interrogation and torture team.

446
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:12,210
As the Litvynenkos ran

447
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,900
from the indiscriminate fire,
their daughter was shot.

448
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,513
Mykola pleaded with the
Russians to save her.

449
00:30:19,754 --> 00:30:24,421
They were taken to a Russian
base at a nearby farmhouse.

450
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,180
As the conflict evolved,

451
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,670
Russia's needs for Wagner also evolved.

452
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,130
Russia put a lot more
focus on its operations

453
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,290
in the east of Ukraine.

454
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:46,957
Wagner Group became a
critical part of this.

455
00:32:14,158 --> 00:32:17,190
Here you see them really
serving the purpose

456
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,350
of doing a couple of different things.

457
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,910
One, that frontline piece

458
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:23,460
but also they've obviously
been very important

459
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,377
for force mobilization.

460
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,990
Wagner began recruiting from prisons

461
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:40,050
to make up for large Russian
losses on the battlefield

462
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:44,217
and to avoid drafting more
civilians into the war.

463
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,920
This method was used in
World War II by Stalin.

464
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,890
Going into the prisons,
pulling people out,

465
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,120
putting them on the front line,

466
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,720
turning them into cannon fodder.

467
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,770
The move to recruit from prisons

468
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:13,410
signified a new phase for Wagner,

469
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:17,070
one in which the group stepped
firmly out of the shadows.

470
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,380
It represents the clearest evidence yet

471
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,110
of just how connected
Wagner's operations are

472
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,677
to the Kremlin.

473
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:25,200
The Wall Street Journal interviewed

474
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,940
convicts recruited by Wagner

475
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,640
and later captured by Ukrainian forces

476
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,250
who describe being
transported from their prisons

477
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:36,500
to the front lines in
Ukraine with state resources.

478
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,030
Social media videos gathered and verified

479
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,310
by The Journal show dozens of trucks

480
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:50,700
with federal prison markings
arriving at commercial airports

481
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,073
and military airfields across the country.

482
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,460
At the airport in Penza, Russia,

483
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,910
these trucks can be seen
driving onto the tarmac.

484
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,650
Men who appear to be prisoners

485
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,560
unload from the trucks
near several airplanes,

486
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,480
at least one of which is registered

487
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,563
to the Russian Air Force.

488
00:34:55,287 --> 00:34:58,260
The fact that Prigozhin
can recruit in prisons

489
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,143
demonstrates the level of
power that he achieved.

490
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,560
I think you can likely expect to see

491
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,390
an expansion for Wagner

492
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,240
of its contracts and ties within Russia

493
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,002
so long as it's perceived
to be successful.

494
00:35:21,513 --> 00:35:23,970
By May of 2023,

495
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,450
the man who started out 10
years ago as Putin's chef

496
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,210
was openly attacking
Russia's Ministry of Defense

497
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,433
and its top commander in Ukraine,

498
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,391
acts that would send most to prison.

499
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,100
We should expect the Wagner
Group to continually change

500
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,891
according to Russia's fortunes
when it comes to arms,

501
00:36:17,891 --> 00:36:21,273
guns, gas, oil, and gold.

502
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:26,520
I think it's likely that in the future

503
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,520
you won't have any contracts
with the Wagner Group publicly

504
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,813
in any jurisdiction outside
of Russia or its close allies.

505
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,110
We may see a new name.

506
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,670
Could be anything, could
be Tchaikovsky Group.

507
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,503
We don't know.

508
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:43,500
At this point in time,

509
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,193
Wagner activity is confirmed
on at least four continents.

510
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,433
It's not only about Africa,

511
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,823
it's also about Latin America.

512
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,960
It's not just that Russia

513
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,150
is spreading its influence
in these countries,

514
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,150
but Russia is further destabilizing

515
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,383
some of the areas where global
security is at its weakest.

516
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,303
Democracy's at stake in
many of these countries.

517
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:18,210
But what's at stake is even
something more fundamental

518
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,790
for the people of those jurisdictions,

519
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:22,623
it's their very lives.
